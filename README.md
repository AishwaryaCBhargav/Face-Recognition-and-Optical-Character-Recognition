# Face-Recognition-and-Optical-Character-Recognition
This study is divided into two parts: Task 1 - Face recognition and Task 2 - Optical Character Recognition. In this study, a database of 69 people has been considered. The database consists of individual images of 69 people, each holding a number between 1 and 81. The database consisted of around 5 still images and 5 live images (videos), each of 69 people. To build a larger database for more efficient training of models, 5 extra frames were extracted from each of the videos. Thus, for every person, around 25-30 images were available for training and testing. In Task 1, the objective was to identify the faces (face recognition) of people (present in the database) in an unseen group image. The Task 2 requires the identification of the number that each person is holding through Optical Character Recognition (OCR). These tasks were achieved using the Computer Vision Toolkit of MATLAB R2018b.
